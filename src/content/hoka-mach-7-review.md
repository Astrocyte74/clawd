# Hoka Mach 7 Review - What's New vs Mach 6?

A first run review of the Hoka Mach 7, the successor to the highly-regarded Mach 6. This is a minor update focused on cosmetic changes and outsole grip improvements rather than a complete overhaul.

> [!NOTE]
> **Launch Date:** March 5, 2026 | **Price:** $145 USD | **Weight:** 237g (8.4 oz) | **Drop:** 5mm | **Stack Height:** ~40mm

## Quick Summary

The Mach 7 is a **minor update** to the Mach 6, not a complete redesign. If you loved the Mach 6, you'll find plenty to like here — same lightweight versatile ride, same super critical EVA midsole, same Hoka rocker design. The main changes are:

- ✅ **Improved outsole grip** with new rubber compound for slippery conditions
- ✅ **Cosmetic refresh** with new overlay logo and painted midsole details
- ✅ **Slightly less sculpted** midsole appearance (painted-on speed lines instead of molded)
- ⚠️ **Same midsole foam** as Mach 6 (no new foam technology)
- ⚠️ **Same stack height** and 5mm drop

**Bottom Line:** If you loved the Mach 6, the Mach 7 is a solid incremental improvement. If you were hoping for a major upgrade, you might want to wait for the Mach 8.

---

## Fit & Comfort

**True to size** — go with your normal Hoka sizing. The fit remains consistent with the Mach 6, with Hoka's signature comfortable upper that locks the foot securely in place without being constricting.

> [!TIP]
> **Try Before You Buy:** The Mach 7 fits consistently with other Hoka models, but always try on if possible. Your foot shape and preference for snug vs roomy fits should guide your size choice.

## First Run Impressions

The Mach 7 delivers the same **lightweight versatile ride** that made the Mach 6 a favorite:

- ✅ **Smooth rocker transition** — Hoka's classic rocker geometry makes for an effortless turnover
- ✅ **Good energy return** — Super critical EVA provides nice bounce without being too soft
- ✅ **Versatile pacing** — Handles easy runs, tempo work, and everything in between
- ✅ **Improved grip** — New outsole compound inspires confidence on wet pavement
- ⚠️ **Not a race shoe** — Great for training, but not designed for marathon race day

**Best For:**
- Daily training (easy runs, long runs, tempo work)
- Runners who want one shoe for most training runs
- Hoka fans who loved the Mach 6 and want more of the same
- Wet/slippery conditions (improved outsole grip)

**Not Ideal For:**
- Race day (consider carbon plate shoes instead)
- Speed work (adequate but not specialized)
- Runners wanting maximum cushion (consider Hoka Clifton or Bondi instead)

## Mach 7 vs Mach 6: Should You Upgrade?

### Upgrade If:
- ✅ You need **better wet-weather grip** — new outsole compound is the real improvement
- ✅ Your Mach 6s are **worn out** and you need a replacement
- ✅ You want the **latest colorways** and cosmetic updates

### Stick With Mach 6 If:
- ✅ Your current Mach 6s still have **plenty of life** left
- ✅ You run **mostly in dry conditions** where grip improvements won't matter
- ✅ You want to **save $5** — the Mach 6 is essentially the same shoe

### Consider Alternatives If:
- ✅ You want **maximum cushion** — Hoka Clifton 8, Hoka Bondi 9
- ✅ You want **more speed** — Hoka Mach X (plated version), carbon plate racers
- ✅ You want **more stability** — Hoka Arahi 7 (stability version of Mach)

## Early Verdict

The Mach 7 is a **solid but unremarkable update** to an already excellent shoe. Hoka played it safe here, which isn't necessarily a bad thing — the Mach 6 was already a fantastic lightweight daily trainer.

**Score: 8/10**

- +1 for maintaining the Mach 6's excellent ride
- +1 for improved outsole grip
- -1 for lack of meaningful innovation
- -1 for price increase with minimal upgrades

**Recommended For:**
- Hoka fans who need a replacement for worn Mach 6s
- Runners in wet climates who need better grip
- Anyone wanting a versatile lightweight daily trainer

**Not Recommended For:**
- Mach 6 owners with shoes that still have life left
- Runners expecting major technological updates
- Budget-conscious buyers (wait for sales on Mach 6)
