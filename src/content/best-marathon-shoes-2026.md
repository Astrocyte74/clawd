## 1. Best Carbon Plate Racing Shoes

### 🏆 Winner: ASICS Meta Speed Tokyo Series

The **ASICS Meta Speed Sky Tokyo** and **ASICS Meta Speed Edge Tokyo** are the clear winners for carbon plate racing shoes.

**What Makes Them Special:**
- **Phenomenally lightweight** — Among the lightest carbon shoes on the market
- **Dual density midsole** — FFA foam (soft/bouncy) + FF Turbo foam (firm/lightweight)
- **Team divided** — Votes split evenly between Sky and Edge

**Sky vs Edge:**

| Feature | Sky Tokyo | Edge Tokyo |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Plate Position** | Higher in foam | Lower/scooped in foam |
| **Foam Order** | FF Turbo on bottom | FF Turbo on top |
| **Preference** | Faster feel | More stable |
| **Best For** | Speed-focused runners | Stability-focused runners |

**Why They Won:**
- All-round racing package that works for wide variety of runners
- Stand out even in crowded market of excellent racing shoes
- Proven performance at marathon distance

### 🥈 Runner Up: Puma Fast-R Nitro Elite 3

**Key Features:**
- **Unbelievably efficient** — Research shows more efficient than many racers
- **Aggressive rockered ride** — Carbon plate extends beyond front of foot
- **Holds up over marathon distance** — Even when form breaks down in second half
- **Extremely lightweight** — Minimal weight penalty

**Trade-offs:**
- Not as cushioned/comfortable as some carbon racers
- Expensive (but no carbon shoes are cheap)

> [!NOTE]
> **Value Tip:** Consider last year's carbon racing shoes — still incredibly good and often significantly cheaper than current models.

### Other Excellent Options

- ASICS Meta Speed Ray
- Hoka Carbon X 3.0
- Saucony Endorphin Elite
- Nike AlphaFly 3
- Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 4
