# Welcome to the Markdown Demo! 🎉

This page was created **entirely with Markdown** — no complex React components needed!

## How It Works

AI agents (or you) can now create pages by simply:

1. **Write a Markdown file** in `src/content/`
2. **Import it** with `?raw` suffix
3. **Pass it to `<MarkdownPage />`**

That's it!

## Features Supported

| Feature | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Bold text** | Easy emphasis |
| *Italic text* | Subtle emphasis |
| ~~Strikethrough~~ | Removed content |
| `inline code` | Technical terms |

### Code Blocks

```javascript
// AI agents can include code examples too!
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}
```

### Lists

- Unordered lists work great
- For bullet points
- And nested items too

1. Numbered lists
2. Are also supported
3. With proper formatting

### Blockquotes

> **Pro tip:** This system makes it incredibly easy for AI agents to generate content without worrying about JSX syntax, component structure, or styling!

## Why This Matters

For **AI-powered workflows**, this is a game-changer:

- ✅ **Simpler prompts** — AI just writes Markdown
- ✅ **Fewer errors** — No complex JSX to get wrong
- ✅ **Faster iteration** — Quick content creation
- ✅ **Consistent styling** — Automatic formatting
